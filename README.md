# Examples for the Bosch IoT Things and Bosch IoT Hub 
This repository contains examples for using the Bosch IoT Things and Hub service in the cloud.

## Bosch IoT Things service ##

The Bosch IoT Things service allows all connected devices like tools, cars, sensors and other Internet enabled things to integrate with cloud services or other applications and to interact with each other.

The IoT Things related examples can be found in the sub project ***/iot-things***

## Bosch IoT Hub service ##

The Bosch IoT Hub service enables developers to uniformly and transparently send and receive device-related messages between cloud services. It specifically supports scalable, reliable and secure data ingestion (telemetry data) as well as command and control type message exchange patterns.
